You are the reason for life, the air inside my lungs
You've taken hold of my heart and there's no doubting
That Your love is unexplainable, phenomenal
And what Your grace has done is nothing but a miracle
So tell me how could I ever turn away from You
When You've always been the way, the life, and the truth?
You've given me a new heart, true reality
I'm living for the One who set me free
You've given mе Your vision, better than a dream
You ain't gotta wakе me up
It's not a fantasy
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
My friends keep saying I've changed, I'm acting different now
They wanna know what I know, they want the truth and so
I told them, "If you're free on Friday, come to youth with me
Leave your past right at the door, and you'll never be alone"
You've given me a new heart, true reality
I'm living for the One who set me free
You've given me Your vision, better than a dream
You ain't gotta wake me up at all
You turned my life right upside down
You set my feet on higher ground
Now I'll never be the same
It's not a phase
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
I'll never be the same
My heart's forever changed
I know the old me is over and buried in the grave
I don't care what they say 'cause
I'll never be ashamed of
His love that saved me 180, the type that's never fading
So now throw up your hands
If you know Him, then go 'head and call up your friends
'Cause we out here on a Friday where it began
And if you owe it all to Jesus (one, two), go do your dance
(One, two, three, four)
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
